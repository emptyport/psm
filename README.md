# peptide-spectrum-match

Very heavily a work in progress. The idea is for this class to be a standard way of dealing with PSMs from X! tandem, mzIdentML, pepXML, and csv files. Anything is subject to change while all the various parsers are written, but I will try to keep things fairly stable during the process.
